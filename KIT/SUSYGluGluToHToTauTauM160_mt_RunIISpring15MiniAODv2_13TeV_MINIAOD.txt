Using trigger efficiency for or of IsoMu22 and IsoTkMu22

[2016-08-03]
This version include
* Muon pT cut of 23, tau pT cut of 30 GeV
* Trigger efficiencies measured in full dataset in dependence of the muon isolation (from Andrew's workspace v3)
* ID/iso scale factors measured in full dataset in dependence of the muon isolation (from Andrew's workspace v3)

Known differences:
* mvamet was produced with wrong weights

[2016-08-18]
First version for miniAODv2 reHLT sample
This version includes
* Muon pT cut of 23, tau pT cut of 30 GeV
* Using trigger efficiency for or of IsoMu22 and IsoTkMu22
* Trigger efficiencies measured in full dataset in dependence of the muon isolation (from Andrew's workspace v3)
* ID/iso scale factors measured in full dataset in dependence of the muon isolation (from Andrew's workspace v3)

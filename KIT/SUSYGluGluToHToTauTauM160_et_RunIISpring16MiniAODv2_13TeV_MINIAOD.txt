[2016-08-18]
First version based on 160 GeV miniAODv2 reHLT sample.
This version includes
* electron pT cut of 26, tau pT cut of 30 GeV
* Trigger efficiencies measured in full dataset in dependence of the electron isolation (from Andrew's workspace v3)
* ID/iso scale factors measured in full dataset in dependence of the electron isolation (from Andrew's workspace v3)

17 Feb 2017 :
 - Includes Tau Energy Corrections
 - TES shifts are 3%
 - look for variables:
  - ptCor_1 for pt_1 with TEC
  - pt_1_DM1_UP is ptCor_1 with DM1 taus shifted up 0.6%
  - also added are m_visCor + m_visCor_DMX_UP/DOWN the DM shifted TES
  - Higgs_PtCor & Higgs_PtCor_DMX_UP/DOWN
 - additionally there are svFit variables using the same naming
  - m_sv_DMX_UP/DOWN
  - pt_sv_DMX_UP/DOWN

13 Feb 2017 :
 - Added svFit variables
 - Using new recoil corrections
 - Recoil corrected met is saved as metcor, metphicor
 - Sample is treated as Boson for recoil corrections

31 Jan 2017 :
 - Added new trigger weights
  - Applying data/MC SF for trigweight_1 & trigweight_2
  - This is a lumi weighted SF, I am adding details to the twiki now...
 - Still no cut applied on HLT trigger passing or failing in this NTuple

30 Jan 2017 : 1st Moriond17 sync set
 - All default correction are from 2016 ICHEP values
 - No additional Jet Correction beyond default
 - No svFit
 - Using ICHEP trigger weights

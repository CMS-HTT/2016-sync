VBF sample used:
- SM selections (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SMTauTau2016#Baseline_selections)
- Svfit and recoil corrections to be added when computing finishes. 
- Jet Pf ID updated today, needs to be checked. (VBF variables synced with cecile before change)
- No trigger required at selection level. lTrigger contains trigger pass info for the lepton
- Sorting by isolaiton

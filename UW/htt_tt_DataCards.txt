This is a where I am storing my data card root file based on the current HTT categorization + inclusive category:

/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2016-Sync/htt_tt.inputs-sm-13TeV_svFitMass-5040Pt-TightIso-ICHEP-21Oct2016.root - 1D card
/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2016-Sync/htt_tt.inputs-sm-13TeV_svFitMass2D-5040Pt-TightIso-ICHEP-21Oct2016.root - 2D card

Included in 1D:
- inclusive
- 0jet
- 1jet low
- 1jet high
- vbf low
- vbf high

Included in 2D:
- 0jet
- 1jet2D
- 2jet2D
(see twiki for binning)

Shapes:
Tau Energy Shifts +/- 3%
DY Shape based off of the MSSM reweight file
ttbar shape for top pt reweighting

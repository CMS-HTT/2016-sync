# 2016-sync
2016 incarnation of synchronisation for the machine learning effort in an analysis of 2016+2017 data

See here for instructions how to produce sync trees: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HiggsToTauTauWorking2017#Synchronisation

Please create a subfolder for a given analysis team, and add txt files (and sym links if you deem them useful) containing the latest sync files for a given channel and a short description (e.g. what's missing, what changed, etc)
